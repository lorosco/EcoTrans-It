# EcoTrans-It
A project that use data about energy production and consumption to compute losses and contact the concerned organism.

## Context
As part of the EPSI's Workshop of 2022-2023 under the theme of energy transition, the team composed of Victor MARTIN, Galdric POUJOL, John CLINTON and LÃ©onard OROSCO decided to work on a kind of smart grid that aim to be used by government instances to evaluate the energetic production and consumption within a defined area.
This evaluation should reveal losses between energy creation and energy consumption in order to make government instances able to contact the organism in charge of the infrastructure where the losses have been computed.
